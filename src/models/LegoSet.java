    //-------------------

    //TODO numberOfInstructionBooklets(): Add this method that has a return type of int.
    //     It should return the number of items stored in the ArrayList.


    // TODO addInstructionBooklet(InstructionBooklet):  Add a method that will add an instruction booklet to
    //      the ArrayList. The return type of this method is boolean.  The method should return true if
    //      successful, false otherwise.


    // TODO listInstructionBooklets(): Add a method that will return a list all of the instruction booklets (return
    //      type of this method is String).  Each booklet should be on it's own line and should be preceded with
    //      the index number in the array list e.g.
    //         0: InstructionBook1.pdf (6 pages)
    //         1: InstructionBook2.pdf (1 page)
    //         2: InstructionBook3.pdf (2 pages)


    //TODO isValidIndex(int): Add a method that will return true if the value of the index (passed as a
    //     parameter) is a valid index number in the instruction booklets array list.  If the index is invalid
    //     return false.  The return type of this method is boolean.


    //TODO findInstructionBooklet(int): Add a method that will return the instruction booklet at a specific
    //     index in the array list.  If the index is invalid, null is returned instead.  The return type of this
    //     method is InstructionBooklet.


    //TODO deleteInstructionBooklet(int): Add a method that will delete the instruction booklet at a specific
    //     index in the array list.  If the index is invalid, null is returned instead.  The return type of this
    //     method is InstructionBooklet.


    //TODO updateInstructionBooklet(int, String, int): Add a method that will take in three parameters:
    //     - The first parameter is the index of the instruction booklet in the arraylist.
    //     - The second parameter is the new value for the filename.
    //     - The third parameter is the new value for the number of pages.
    //     The method will update update the fileName and numberOfPages for an instruction booklet at a
    //     specific index in the array list.
    //     It will return true if the update was successful. If the index is invalid, false is returned instead.
    //     The return type of this method is boolean.
